# Privacy Policy – meni.ge Customer Application

**Last updated: 5 December 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how Individual Entrepreneur (Sole Proprietor) Andrei Verbitskii (Georgian TIN 305573448) ("we", "us", "our") collects and uses personal data when you use the customer-facing meni.ge application available at https://meni.ge and via QR codes in participating venues (the "Customer Application").

The Customer Application is part of the meni.ge platform used by cafés and restaurants to manage orders and guests. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Customer Application that guests and visitors see and use. In this Policy, we refer to the Customer Application and closely related features collectively as the "Service".

We are committed to protecting your privacy and processing your personal data in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The meni.ge platform also includes a separate back-office / administrative application used by venue staff and administrators. This Privacy Policy does not cover that back-office application; the processing of personal data in the back office may be described in separate privacy information provided to staff and venue operators.

## 3. Personal data we collect

Depending on how you use the Service, we may collect the following categories of data.

### 3.1 Registration and profile data

### 3.7 Analytics data (Google and Meta/Facebook)

We use analytics services Google Analytics 4, Firebase Analytics, Meta Pixel and Meta app events to understand how the Service is used and to improve it. These services may collect:

- Pseudonymous identifiers (for example, app instance ID, cookie ID)
- Aggregated usage statistics (e.g. number of visits, session duration)

- Records of your requests regarding your data (access, deletion, etc.) and our responses

## 4. Purposes and legal bases for processing

Under the GDPR we must have a legal basis for each processing purpose. Depending on the situation, we rely on:

- Performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR)
- Compliance with legal obligations (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR)

**Legal bases:**

### 4.2 Geolocation

We use geolocation to:

- Show you relevant venues or the correct menu for your location

You can disable geolocation in your device or browser settings at any time. This does not affect processing carried out before such change but may limit some features.

### 4.3 Photos and caricatures

We process photos and caricatures to:

- Create a caricature from your photograph using our algorithms or third-party tools
- Display the caricature in your account and, where configured by a venue, to staff (for example, for a more personalized experience)

- Diagnose and fix technical problems

**Legal basis:**
- Our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) – to provide a secure, stable and convenient Service

### 4.6 Analytics: Google Analytics 4, Firebase Analytics, Meta Pixel, Meta app events

We use Google Analytics 4, Firebase Analytics, Meta Pixel and Meta app events for analytics only, not for showing advertising in the Customer Application.

**Purposes of analytics:**
- Measuring usage of the Service (number of users, sessions, features used)
- Understanding general behavioural patterns (for example, at what time the app is most used, which screens are most popular)
- Improving usability, performance and reliability of the Service
- Detecting technical problems and abnormal usage

**Important:**
- We do not use your personal data from the Customer Application to show you third-party advertising in the Customer Application.
- We do not sell or rent your personal data to any third party.
- We do not allow third parties to use data from the Customer Application for their own advertising or marketing purposes.

Where required by law, we obtain your consent before placing analytics cookies or using analytics SDKs. You can withdraw your consent at any time through your browser, device or in-app settings. This will not affect processing carried out before withdrawal.

**Legal bases:**
- Your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) – where consent is required for analytics
- Our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) – to understand and improve how the Service is used, where basic analytics without consent is lawfully permitted

Google and Meta/Facebook may also process certain data as independent controllers. For more details on their processing, please refer to their own privacy policies.

## 5. No use of data for advertising and no sale of data

We do not:

- Use your personal data from the Customer Application to show you third-party advertising in the Customer Application
- Sell or rent your personal data
- Share your data with third parties so that they can use it for their own marketing or advertising

Analytics data is used solely for internal analytics and improvement of the Service.

## 6. Sharing of your personal data

As a general rule, personal data is processed within our platform and infrastructure. We do not share your personal data with third parties for their own independent purposes, except in the following limited cases:

### Platform and hosting providers

We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host our systems and databases. Our servers are located in the eu-central-1 (Frankfurt, Germany) region. AWS acts as our data processor and processes data only according to our instructions.

### Analytics providers

We transmit certain pseudonymous and technical data to Google (Google Analytics 4, Firebase Analytics) and Meta/Facebook (Meta Pixel, Meta app events) for analytics purposes described above.

### Venue operators

When you place an order or interact with a particular café or restaurant, we share the necessary information with the operator of that venue so they can serve you, for example:

- Your order details
- Time and place of order
- Table or area (where applicable)
- Preferred name or nickname
- Relevant communication history with that venue (for example, your messages related to an order)

Venue operators use this information as independent data controllers. They may have their own privacy policies; we encourage you to review them where available.

### Service providers and professional advisers

We may share data with IT service providers, security providers, auditors, accountants and legal advisers where this is necessary and subject to confidentiality obligations.

### Authorities and legal obligations

We may disclose personal data if required to do so by law, court order or a competent authority, or to protect our rights or the rights of other persons (for example, in case of fraud, abuse or disputes).

In all such cases, we limit access to what is necessary and, where required, conclude data processing agreements or other appropriate safeguards.

## 7. International data transfers and storage location

We primarily store and process your data on servers located in:

**Frankfurt, Germany (AWS region eu-central-1)**

This means your data is stored within the European Economic Area (EEA).

However, some of our service providers (for example Google and Meta/Facebook) may process data in other countries, including outside the EEA. Where such transfers occur, we rely on appropriate safeguards under the GDPR, such as:

- Adequacy decisions of the European Commission, and/or
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission, possibly combined with additional technical and organisational measures

More information about these safeguards is available on request.

## 8. Data retention

As a rule, we do not keep your personal data longer than necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or as required by law.

We follow the general principle that:

**Files, documents, activities and related personal data are stored for up to 5 (five) years.**

In practice, this means:

### Account and profile data
We store your account data while your account is active and for up to 5 years after your last significant interaction with the Service, unless you request earlier deletion and we are not legally required to keep certain data.

### Order history and venue interactions
We store order data and the history of interactions with venues for up to 5 years, taking into account accounting, tax, consumer protection and limitation periods. After this period, data will be deleted or anonymised.

### Photos and caricatures
We store your photos and caricatures while your account is active or until you delete them via your account or the data deletion page. In any case, we do not store them longer than 5 years from the time of your last relevant interaction, unless longer retention is required by law or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

### Technical logs and device data
Technical logs and device data used for security and diagnostics are stored only as long as reasonably necessary, but not longer than 5 years, unless a specific log is needed longer for security or legal reasons.

### Analytics data
Analytics data collected through Google Analytics 4, Firebase Analytics, Meta Pixel and Meta app events is retained according to our configuration of those tools and applicable law. Our intention is that analytics data that may be linked to an identifiable user will not be kept for more than 5 years.

After the relevant retention period expires, we will either delete the data or irreversibly anonymise it so that it can no longer be linked to you.

## 9. Your rights under GDPR

Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

### Right of access
You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether we process your personal data and, if so, to receive a copy of that data.

### Right to rectification
You have the right to have inaccurate personal data corrected and incomplete data completed.

### Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
You have the right to request deletion of your personal data, subject to our legal obligations (for example, to keep certain transaction data for accounting or tax purposes).

### Right to restriction of processing
You can request that we restrict processing in certain circumstances (for example, when the accuracy of data is contested).

### Right to data portability
You have the right to receive certain personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit it to another controller, where processing is based on consent or contract and carried out by automated means.

### Right to object
You can object to processing based on our legitimate interests. We will stop such processing unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds or the processing is necessary for legal claims.

### Right to withdraw consent
Where processing is based on your consent (for example, analytics, geolocation, photos), you may withdraw your consent at any time. This does not affect the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.

### Right to lodge a complaint
You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority if you believe that your rights have been violated.

To exercise your rights, please contact us at **info@meni.ge** or use the self-service tools described below. We may need to verify your identity before responding.

## 10. Data deletion page and self-service controls

We provide a dedicated "Delete my data" function:

You can request deletion of your personal data on the following page:  
**https://meni.ge/privacy/delete**

Through this page and/or your account settings, you can:

- Request deletion of your account and profile data
- Delete photos and caricatures (where available in the interface)
- Request deletion of your order and communication history, where this is not in conflict with our legal obligations
- Withdraw consents for analytics and/or geolocation (where these settings are available)

We will process your request without undue delay and within the time limits required by GDPR. Please note that we may need to retain some data if required by law (for example, for tax and accounting purposes) or where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

## 11. Security

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data, including:

- Encryption of data in transit (for example, HTTPS/TLS)
- Access controls and authentication for systems and personnel
- Regular software updates and security monitoring
- Backups and disaster recovery procedures
- Internal policies and training to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data

However, no system can be completely secure. If we become aware of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify you and the relevant supervisory authority where required by law.

## 12. Children's privacy

The Customer Application is not intended for children under 16 years of age.

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16 without verifiable parental or guardian consent, where required by law. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal data in violation of this Policy, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete such data.

## 13. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will:

- Update the "Last updated" date at the top of the Policy, and
- Provide additional notice within the Service where appropriate (for example, a notification in the app or on the website).

We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we process your personal data.
