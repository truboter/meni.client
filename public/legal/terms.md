# Terms of Service – meni.ge Customer Application

**Last updated: 5 December 2025**

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the customer-facing meni.ge application available at https://meni.ge and via QR codes in participating venues (the "Customer Application" or "Service").

The Service is provided by Individual Entrepreneur (Sole Proprietor) Andrei Verbitskii (Georgian TIN 305573448) ("we", "us", "our", "meni.ge").

**IMPORTANT:** By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.

Language and translations: These Terms of Service are drafted in English and the English version is the original and legally binding version. Any versions of these Terms that you may see in other languages are generated by machine translation and are provided solely for your convenience. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between a translated version and the English version, the English version shall always prevail.

## 1. About the Service

### 1.1 Service provider

**Individual Entrepreneur (Sole Proprietor) Andrei Verbitskii**  
Georgian TIN: 305573448

**Registered address (Georgia):**  
6010, საქართველო, ქალაქი ბათუმი, გრიგოლ ელიავას ქუჩა, N 32ე, სართული 2, ბინა N201ა

**Contact email:** info@meni.ge

### 1.2 What is meni.ge

meni.ge is a digital platform that enables cafés, restaurants and other venues ("Establishments" or "Venues") to provide digital menus and accept orders from their guests.

The Customer Application is the guest-facing part of the meni.ge platform that allows you to:

- Browse digital menus at participating Establishments
- View menu items in multiple languages (up to 27 languages)
- View prices with approximate currency conversion
- Place orders and transmit them to venue staff
- Make table reservations (where available)
- Upload photos to create caricatures for your profile
- Specify dietary preferences and restrictions
- View your order history and interactions with venues
- Communicate with venue staff about your orders

### 1.3 Platform model

**Important:** meni.ge provides the technology platform. We are **not** the seller of food, beverages or other items shown in the menus. Each Establishment is an independent business and is solely responsible for:

- Menu content, pricing and availability
- Food preparation, quality and safety
- Customer service at the venue
- Accepting or rejecting orders
- Payment processing
- Compliance with local health, safety and licensing regulations

Your orders are placed with the Establishment, not with meni.ge. Any disputes about food, service, pricing or payment should be directed to the Establishment.

### 1.4 No payment processing by meni.ge

We do **not** process payments. Payment is made directly at the Establishment, either to staff or via the Establishment's own payment system. We are not a party to any payment transaction.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

### 2.2 Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes:

- We will update the "Last updated" date at the top

If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Service.

#### 2.2.1 Right to object to changes

When we notify you of changes to these Terms, you have **6 weeks** from the date of notification to object to the changes.

If you object within this period:

- Either party (you or we) may terminate the Service relationship with reasonable notice
- If we do not terminate, the previous Terms will continue to apply to you

If you do not object within 6 weeks, the changes will be deemed accepted and will apply to your continued use of the Service.

**Important:** When we notify you of changes, we will explicitly inform you of:

- Your right to object within 6 weeks
- The consequences of not objecting (deemed acceptance)
- Your right and our right to terminate if you object

This objection right applies to existing users. If you are a new user, the current Terms apply from the moment you start using the Service.

### 2.3 Additional terms from Establishments
