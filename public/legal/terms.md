## 1. About the Service

### 1.1 Service provider

**Individual Entrepreneur (Sole Proprietor) Andrei Verbitskii**  
Georgian TIN: 305573448

### 1.2 What is meni.ge

meni.ge is a digital platform that enables cafés, restaurants and other venues ("Establishments" or "Venues") to provide digital menus and accept orders from their guests.

The Customer Application is the guest-facing part of the meni.ge platform that allows you to:

- Browse digital menus at participating Establishments
- View menu items in multiple languages (up to 27 languages)
- View prices with approximate currency conversion
- Place orders and transmit them to venue staff
- Make table reservations (where available)
- Upload photos to create caricatures for your profile
- Specify dietary preferences and restrictions
- View your order history and interactions with venues
- Communicate with venue staff about your orders

### 1.3 Platform model

**Important:** meni.ge provides the technology platform. We are **not** the seller of food, beverages or other items shown in the menus. Each Establishment is an independent business and is solely responsible for:

- Menu content, pricing and availability
- Food preparation, quality and safety
- Customer service at the venue
- Accepting or rejecting orders
- Payment processing
- Compliance with local health, safety and licensing regulations

Your orders are placed with the Establishment, not with meni.ge. Any disputes about food, service, pricing or payment should be directed to the Establishment.

### 1.4 No payment processing by meni.ge

We do **not** process payments. Payment is made directly at the Establishment, either to staff or via the Establishment's own payment system. We are not a party to any payment transaction.
