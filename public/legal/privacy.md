We do not:

- Use your personal data from the Customer Application to show you third-party advertising in the Customer Application
- Sell or rent your personal data
- Share your data with third parties so that they can use it for their own marketing or advertising

Analytics data is used solely for internal analytics and improvement of the Service.

## 6. Sharing of your personal data

As a general rule, personal data is processed within our platform and infrastructure. We do not share your personal data with third parties for their own independent purposes, except in the following limited cases:

<!-- "Data processor" is a specific GDPR legal term for entities that process data on behalf of the controller. -->
### Platform and hosting providers

We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host our systems and databases. Our servers are located in the eu-central-1 (Frankfurt, Germany) region. AWS acts as our data processor and processes data only according to our instructions.

We also use AWS CloudFront as our Content Delivery Network (CDN) to ensure fast and reliable delivery of the Service globally. The CDN processes technical data (such as IP addresses, request data) as part of content delivery.

<!-- -->
### Analytics providers

We transmit certain pseudonymous and technical data to Google (Google Analytics 4, Firebase Analytics) and Meta/Facebook (Meta Pixel, Meta app events) for analytics purposes described above.

### Error monitoring and crash reporting

We use Sentry (Functional Software, Inc.) to monitor application errors and crashes. When an error occurs, Sentry may collect:

- Error messages and stack traces
- Device and browser information
- User actions leading to the error (breadcrumbs)
- Session replay data (with all text masked and media blocked for privacy)

We configure Sentry to:
- Store data in the European Union (EU data residency)

Sentry acts as our data processor for error monitoring purposes. You can learn more about Sentry's privacy practices at https://sentry.io/privacy/

<!-- -->
<!-- "Independent data controllers" means they control their own data processing decisions, not acting on our behalf. -->
### Venue operators

When you place an order or interact with a particular café or restaurant, we share the necessary information with the operator of that venue so they can serve you, for example:

- Time and place of order or reservation
- Table or area (where applicable)
- Preferred name or nickname
- Dietary preferences or restrictions (if you provided them)

<!-- -->
### Service providers and professional advisers

We may share data with IT service providers, security providers, auditors, accountants and legal advisers where this is necessary and subject to confidentiality obligations.

### Authorities and legal obligations

We may disclose personal data if required to do so by law, court order or a competent authority, or to protect our rights or the rights of other persons (for example, in case of fraud, abuse or disputes).

In all such cases, we limit access to what is necessary and, where required, conclude data processing agreements or other appropriate safeguards.

<!-- "EEA" stands for European Economic Area. "Adequacy decisions" and "Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)" are specific GDPR legal mechanisms. -->
## 7. International data transfers and storage location

We primarily store and process your data on servers located in:

**Frankfurt, Germany (AWS region eu-central-1)**

This means your data is stored within the European Economic Area (EEA).

However, some of our service providers (for example Google and Meta/Facebook) may process data in other countries, including outside the EEA. Where such transfers occur, we rely on appropriate safeguards under the GDPR, such as:

- Adequacy decisions of the European Commission, and/or
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission, possibly combined with additional technical and organisational measures

<!-- -->
More information about these safeguards is available on request.

## 8. Data retention

As a rule, we do not keep your personal data longer than necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or as required by law.

We follow the general principle that:

**Files, documents, activities and related personal data are stored for up to 5 (five) years.**

In practice, this means:

### Account and profile data

We store your account data while your account is active and for up to 5 years after your last significant interaction with the Service, unless you request earlier deletion and we are not legally required to keep certain data.

### Order history and venue interactions

We store order data, reservation data and the history of interactions with venues for up to 5 years, taking into account accounting, tax, consumer protection and limitation periods. After this period, data will be deleted or anonymised.

### Dietary preferences and restrictions

We store dietary preferences and restrictions while your account is active or until you delete them. This data is retained for the same period as your account data (up to 5 years after your last interaction) to help ensure your safety and preferences are remembered across visits.

### Photos and caricatures

We store your photos and caricatures while your account is active or until you delete them via your account or the data deletion page. In any case, we do not store them longer than 5 years from the time of your last relevant interaction, unless longer retention is required by law or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

### Technical logs and device data

Technical logs, device data and push notification tokens used for security and diagnostics are stored only as long as reasonably necessary, but not longer than 5 years, unless a specific log is needed longer for security or legal reasons.

Push notification tokens are deleted when you disable notifications or delete your account.

### Analytics data

Analytics data collected through Google Analytics 4, Firebase Analytics, Meta Pixel and Meta app events is retained according to our configuration of those tools and applicable law. Our intention is that analytics data that may be linked to an identifiable user will not be kept for more than 5 years.

After the relevant retention period expires, we will either delete the data or irreversibly anonymise it so that it can no longer be linked to you.

<!-- Articles 15-22 GDPR define specific data subject rights. Keep article numbers for legal reference. -->
## 9. Your rights under GDPR

### Right to withdraw consent

Where processing is based on your consent (for example, analytics, geolocation, photos), you may withdraw your consent at any time. This does not affect the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.

### Right to lodge a complaint

## 10a. Automated decision-making and profiling

We do **not** use your personal data for automated decision-making (including profiling) that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you within the meaning of GDPR Article 22.

We may use analytics and aggregated data to understand usage patterns and improve the Service, but these activities do not constitute automated decision-making under Article 22. You are not subject to decisions based solely on automated processing.

<!-- -->
## 11. Security

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data, including:

- Encryption of data in transit (for example, HTTPS/TLS)
- Access controls and authentication for systems and personnel
- Regular software updates and security monitoring
- Backups and disaster recovery procedures
- Internal policies and training to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data

<!-- "Personal data breach" is a specific GDPR term for security incidents involving personal data. -->
However, no system can be completely secure. If we become aware of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify you and the relevant supervisory authority where required by law.

<!-- -->
## 12. Children's privacy

The Customer Application is not intended for children under 16 years of age.
